What's important is the order *direction*, which is either incoming or outgoing. Order IDs are guaranteed unique within that context. As a seller, this means you can aggregate lists of incoming orders from many Buyers, or outgoing orders to many Suppliers. You may filter a list by Buyer or Supplier, but it's not required to uniquely identify an Order. (Buyers typically only deal with outgoing Orders; Suppliers with incoming.) Buyers add Line Items to Orders by specifying a Product, Quantity, and (optionally) Spec values. Shipping is applied at either the Order level or Line Item level.
