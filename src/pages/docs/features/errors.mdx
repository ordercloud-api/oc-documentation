## Overview

OrderCloud.io uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success and codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter). Only when something goes terribly wrong on our end will you receive a `500` response. As long as the platform is responding you can count on the response body taking a standard shape.
