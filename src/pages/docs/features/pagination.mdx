## Overview

Most OrderCloud.io Resources include a method for listing items from that Resource. These resources can potentially include thousands of items so restricting the data that is returned from such a request is not only practical but necessary. OrderCloud.io offers server-side pagination that partitions the data returned from these requests into manageable chunks to optimize client-side performance

## Listing

A request to list a resource will return an object with two values: `Meta` and `Items`. The `Meta` value returns important information regarding your query, such as total results, how many results are shown in the `Items` array, how many more pages of results there are, and what page you are currently on. The `Items` array stores the actual results of the resource you are querying.

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 CREATED
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

  {
    "Meta": {
      "Page": 1,
      "PageSize": 20,
      "TotalCount": 25,
      "TotalPages": 2,
      "ItemRange": [1, 20]
    },
    "Items": ["..."]
  }
```

Lists default to 20 items per page, but you can set the `pageSize` up to 100\. If you have more results than the page count, you will have multiple pages. You can use the `Page` and `PageSize` values from the `Meta` object to specify the page (starting at 1) and items per page. Note that unlike the page parameter, `ItemRange` values are zero-based.
