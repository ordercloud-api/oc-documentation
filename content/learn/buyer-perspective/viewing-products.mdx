In the last guide, we changed perspectives to a buyer user that has the `Shopper` role available. This provides access to some additional Me resources including the **My Products** resource.

## Listing Buyer Products
Let's retrieve a list of products available to our buyer user.

<CodeExample
  title="Get a list of buyer products"
  content={{
    http: `GET https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/me/products HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8;`,
javascript: `import { Tokens, Me } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Tokens.Set("INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE")\n
Me.ListProducts()
  .then(response => {
      // returns the first page of buyer products
      console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(err => console.log(err.message));`,
typescript: `import { Tokens, Me, BuyerProduct, OrderCloudError } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Me.ListProducts()
  .then((response: ListPage<BuyerProduct>) => {
      // returns the first page of buyer products
      console.log(response);
  })
  .catch((err:OrderCloudError) => console.log(err.message));`,
csharp: `using OrderCloud.SDK;\n
// see previous example for configuring OrderCloudClient
var client = new OrderCloudClient(...);\n
try
{
	ListPage<BuyerProduct> buyerProducts = await _oc.Me.ListProductsAsync();
} catch(OrderCloudException ex)
{
	Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}`}}
/>

Notice we did not pass any parameters yet. Your response should look something like this:

```json
{
	"Meta": {
		"Facets": [],
		"Page": 1,
		"PageSize": 20,
		"TotalCount": 1,
		"TotalPages": 1,
		"ItemRange": [
			1,
			1
		]
	},
	"Items": [
		{
			"PriceSchedule": {
				"ID": "SHIRT_PRICE",
				"Name": "Cotton T-Shirt Price",
				"ApplyTax": false,
				"ApplyShipping": false,
				"MinQuantity": 1,
				"MaxQuantity": null,
				"UseCumulativeQuantity": false,
				"RestrictedQuantity": false,
				"PriceBreaks": [
					{
						"Quantity": 1,
						"Price": 10
					}
				],
				"xp": null
			},
			"ID": "SHIRT",
			"Name": "Cotton T-Shirt",
			"Description": "A plain white, cotton shirt for everyday use.",
			"QuantityMultiplier": 1,
			"ShipWeight": null,
			"ShipHeight": null,
			"ShipWidth": null,
			"ShipLength": null,
			"Active": true,
			"SpecCount": 0,
			"VariantCount": 0,
			"ShipFromAddressID": null,
			"Inventory": null,
			"DefaultSupplierID": null,
			"xp": null
		}
	]
}
```

As you can see, OrderCloud has flattened out the relationships between our buyer user and the `SHIRT` product. The buyer user's organization, `BUYER_ORGANIZATION`, has the default catalog `BUYER_ORGANIZATION`, which has the `SHIRT` product assigned to it with a default price schedule of `SHIRT_PRICE`.

### Buyer Product Model
My Products introduces a new OrderCloud model called `BuyerProduct` here. This type of product has a price schedule attached as a sub-object, allowing developers quick access to pricing information without needing to make additional API calls.

### List Page with Facets
Another interesting part of this response model is the `Facets` property within the `Meta` information. Facets are unique to resources that have been enhanced with elastic search in OrderCloud's backend. This topic is covered in other reading.

## Filtering the Buyer Products
The buyer product list request will return all products, regardless of which catalog they belong to, given the necessary assignments have been configured. With this in mind, you may want to filter buyer products for a given scenario. Some common applications of filtering include:
- **Browse by Catalog** - To return only buyer products for a specific catalog, set the `CatalogID` parameter value accordingly.
- **Browse by Category** - If our buyer organization's default catalog or other catalog contained products assigned to categories, then we can filter buyer products to a given category by specifying both the `CatalogID` and `CategoryID` parameters to identify the unique category.

Creating a unique experience entirely depends on how you take advantage of the parameters available to you. You can create a faceted product search, a category browse experience, or something completely custom using advanced querying.
