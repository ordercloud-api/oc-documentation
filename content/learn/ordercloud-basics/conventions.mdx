The OrderCloud API adheres to a RESTful architectural style. URIs, HTTP verbs, headers, payloads, and response codes all follow consistent and predictable patterns. This doc will outline conventions that permeate the entire platform.

## SSL Everywhere

API access is only allowed via HTTPS; connections on port 80 are refused entirely. This simplifies the token-based authentication.

## JSON Everywhere

UTF-8 encoded JSON is currently the only supported data format for both request and response payloads.

## Date Format

Dates/times returned in the API are in UTC time and conform to [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

## OAuth 2

OrderCloud API authentication is based on the [OAuth 2 specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and supports four different workflows, or, in OAuth terms, grant types. Check out our <Link to="/knowledge-base/authentication">workflows guide</Link> to learn more.

## Writeable IDs

Writable IDs can be extremely useful for back-office integrations as they can eliminate the need for a mapping middleware layer.

Most resources that map to an entity of some sort (Orders, Users, Addresses, etc.) contain an ID that is optionally writable on creation or update. If you do not pass one, one will be auto-generated and returned in the response, and will be guaranteed to be unique. If you choose to pass an ID, you are responsible for ensuring uniqueness. Things that live under the context of a single Buyer need only be unique within that context. Things that are shared (such as products) must be unique across the entire Seller organization.

## Error Handling

For all unsuccessful requests, we attempt to return the [most appropriate HTTP status in the 400 range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_Error). So long as our platform is responding (i.e. returning anything in the 4xx range or 500), you can count on the response body taking a standard shape.

## HTTP Methods

A resource is a set of endpoints used to interact with an object of that same name. OrderCloud adheres to RESTful conventions in its usage of HTTP verbs. You can expect a subset of the following methods to exist on every Resource.

| OrderCloud Verb | HTTP Verb | Meaning                                                          | Example                                                 |
| --------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET             | GET       | Returns a specific item                                          | Get a single address                                    |
| SAVE            | PUT       | Create or replace an item, you provide a unique ID               | Create address ABC, overwriting it if it already exists |
| PATCH           | PATCH     | Use it for updating items                                        | Update the name on an address by providing the new name |
| LIST            | GET       | Returns a list of items                                          | Get a list of addresses                                 |
| CREATE          | POST      | Creates a new item, we generate a unique ID if no ID is provided | Create a new address                                    |
| DELETE          | DELETE    | Deletes an item                                                  | Delete address ABC from the database                    |

## HTTP Status Code Summary

OrderCloud uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success and codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter). Only when something goes terribly wrong on our end will you receive a `500` response. As long as the platform is responding you can count on the response body taking a standard shape.
