OrderCloud community guidelines apply to all OrderCloud support interactions, including public and private channels, direct messages, and in-person communications.  We are dedicated to positive collaboration between our employees and community participants, and providing a safe environment for participants to support each other.  By participating in our community, you agree to our [**Code of Conduct**](/community-guidelines#code-of-conduct) in this document.

## Slack Workspace Guidelines

1. The Slack workspace is provided free of charge as a courtesy to all of our customers. The #ordercloud-support channel is monitored by our internal support and development teams between the hours of 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM CST and we respond to inquiries as time allows. 
    - If you’re looking for more individualized, time sensitive support please contact us about setting up a developer support contract.
2. Please refrain from using @ to tag one specific person and from messaging them privately unless you have been specifically asked to do so.  Our internal teams that monitor this space are made up of many people. Those people’s schedules vary from day to day.
3. Community members are welcomed and encouraged to respond to other developer questions. 

## General Support Guidelines

### Before Asking a questions

1. Make sure you’ve reviewed all available documentation, including the [knowledge base](/knowledge-base) and [API reference](/api-reference) to see if your answer can be found there.
2. Use Slack’s robust built in search functionality to see if anyone else has had a similar question answered in the past.

### Asking Effective questions
1. If you are receiving an unexpected error returned from the OrderCloud API, please write up all of the recreation steps to reproduce the bug, and provide all relevant information, such as endpoint, productIDs, org name and ID, etc.
    - If you are receiving a 500 error specifically, please make note if the error occurs after roughly 30 seconds (this is indicative of a timeout).
    - If you need to provide any sensitive information (such as user emails, etc.), you may be asked to provide those details in a private Slack channel or a DM.
2. If you have a general question on how to best use an OrderCloud feature to model a specific business scenario, please first review the documentation, and then ask any additional clarifying questions you might have.
3. If you are perceiving performance problems, include the specific endpoints that seem to be the culprit, any query parameters you’re including in your request, and the time frame (including time zone) that the problem was observed. 
    - Include screenshots of the browser network tab whenever possible. 
    - We highly recommend using an external monitoring tool such as New Relic to monitor your application, as it can provide you with much more detailed information on potential performance problems.

## Code of Conduct
This code of conduct applies to all OrderCloud spaces, including public and private channels, direct messages, and in-person communication. We do not tolerate harassment of any kind. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be removed from these spaces at our discretion.

### Harassment Includes:
- Comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, pregnancy status, veteran status, political affiliation, marital status, age, race, national origin, ethnic origin, nationality, immigration status, language, religion, or other identity marker. 
- Threats of violence or incitement of violence towards any individual or group.

We reserve the right to expand the above definition of harassment at any time and remove anyone who engages in other types of harassment not explicitly listed above. 

If you are being harassed by a member of our community, or want to report harassment you have witnessed, please email us: [community@ordercloud.io](mailto:community@ordercloud.io)
