summary: To update an existing resource, when should you use `PUT` and when should you use `PATCH`? Here are 4 reasons why you should stop using `PUT` for updates.

Here's a question we hear often:

> To update an existing resource, when should I use `PUT` and when should I use `PATCH`?

## TL;DR Always use `PATCH`.

`PATCH` has several distinct advantages over `PUT` when it comes to updating things:

1. `PUT` requires sending the entire object, hence a larger payload over the network. With `PATCH`, if you only want to change one or a few fields, you only need to send those fields.
2. You often do not have the entire object available to send, in which case `PUT` requires that you first do a GET. With `PATCH`, all you need is the object's ID, and you can often avoid the extra API call.
3. In some cases, `PUT` can have unintended side-effects related to properties you don't want to change. For example, some properties have default values, often inherited from some parent object, that can be overwritten. When you do a GET on such a resource, you'll get the default if it hasn't been overwritten. If you then change some other property and do a `PUT`, you're unintentionally overriding the inherited value with an explicit one. Now if the default value on the parent changes, that change won't flow to the child as expected.
4. If multiple users can modify the same resources, you could run into concurrency issues with `PUT`. For example, suppose user A wants to modify a product's quantity multiplier while user B wants to modify the same product's description. Both users have done a GET and have the product's JSON representation and modify it. If user A `PUT`s their change first, then user B will inadvertently revert the quantity multiplier change when they send their `PUT`. With `PATCH`, user A can send only the quantity multiplier change and user B can send just the updated description, and they are at no risk of a conflict.

All these warnings of great peril beg the question: When _should_ you use `PUT`?

These are the situations where using `PUT` makes sense:

1. You want to create a new resource, and you are providing the ID. Note that you need only provide that ID in the URI. In REST terms, you're basically saying "I have this new object and I know where I want to put it."

Conversely, use `POST` when you want the ID to be auto-generated by the platform, i.e. you want us to decide where to "put" it.)

2. You want to completely _replace_ an object with another. In other words, an object has the same ID (location), but in real world terms it is a different thing. This is a rare case.
3. The object does not have an ID, rather its identity is comprised of other values. These objects typically represent relationships; assignments are a good example. You usually don't even have to remember this rule because `PUT` is often the only verb available for writing to such endpoints.

`PUT` actually has a few nice qualities when used in the above scenarios:

1. `PUT` is idempotent, i.e. you shouldn't need to check if it has already been called, because calling it a second time will leave the resource in exactly the same state as calling it the first time. (`POST`, on the other hand, generally creates a new resource with each successive call.)
2. You generally don't have to worry about checking for existence. For example, if you want to assign a user to a group, you don't need to worry about creating a duplicate assignment - just `PUT` the assignment and it will either create a new one or overwrite the existing one.

## Summary

| Use `POST` when...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Use `PUT` when...                                                                                                                                | Use `PATCH` when...                                                                           |
