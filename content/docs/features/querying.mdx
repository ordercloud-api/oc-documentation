## Overview

Most OrderCloud resources have list endpoints that can return thousands, even hundreds of thousands of items. We understand that effectively querying this data is not only practical but necessary and have built an assortment of API tools to help pinpoint and extract the exact data you and your users need. Up first, let's talk about Search.

## Searching

_Google-esque_ searches, simply provide a search term.

This type of querying is best for natural language searches like a product search on a buyer site. Our search handles case-insensitive word stemming (plural inference for example), synonyms, and intelligently ranks results based on fields relevant to each resource. If you're curious about which default fields are taken into account and how much weight they're given for a search check out our <Link to="/api-reference">API reference</Link>.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/me/products?search=bike HTTP/1.1
```

This will return all results such as bike, words including bike, bikes, bicycle, etc. The fields searched include `ID`,`Name`, and `Description`. (This of course varies from endpoint to endpoint). Fields marked "Searchable" in the API reference will be searched and weighted according to priority level.

You can also optionally specify which fields (of the searchable fields available) are searched by providing a `searchOn` parameter for any field available on the resource you're searching including <Link to="/features/extended-properties">extended properties (XP)</Link>. Here's we're searching on Name and xp.Color so if our search finds a match in either of those two fields we will get a result.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/me/products?search=bike&searchOn=Name,xp.Color HTTP/1.1
```

## Filtering

Filtering is best for looking at specific values in a given field. If you do not require natural language type searching over text fields, filtering is a more performant _and_ more powerful method for querying data.

### Filtering On XP

Let's examine a common scenario of filtering on an <Link to="/features/extended-properties">extended property (XP) field</Link>. Suppose our XP field looks like this:

```json
{
  "xp": {
    "MoreInfo": {
      "TeamName": "Tigers",
      "Gender": "Male"
    }
  }
}
```

We can use dot notation to access deeply nested values. The following call will return all buyers with team name "Tigers"

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/buyers/xyz/users?xp.MoreInfo.TeamName=Tigers HTTP/1.1
```

### Fuzzy Searches

Fuzzy matches are supported using the `*` wildcard character.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/buyers/xyz/users?LastName=*Smith&FirstName=John* HTTP/1.1
```

This will return both "John Smith" and "Johnny McSmooth".

### Logical OR

You can also use `|` as a logical OR.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/buyers/xyz/users?LastName=Smith|Jo*&FirstName=Johnny HTTP/1.1
```

This will return "John Smith", "Johnny Jones", and "John Johnson". Maybe you want "John Smith" but not "John Jones".

### Negate and Logical AND

You can negate your conditions by prefixing them with `!`, and logically `AND` them together by simply providing the same parameter multiple times.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/buyers/xyz/users?LastName=!Smith&LastName=!Jones HTTP/1.1
```

This will return all users _except_ those with last name "Smith" or "Jones".

### Comparison Operators

Dates and numeric values support `>` (greater than) and `<` (less than) prefixes.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/buyers/xyz/users?DateCreated=>2015-01-01 HTTP/1.1
```

For a more advanced example, let's say you want users whose ID is the range of 0 to 9 inclusive. Ranges are not directly supported, but you can use the existing features to achieve this.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/buyers/xyz/users?ID=0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9 HTTP/1.1
```

Of course that's not going to be feasible if the range is very large or you're dealing with floating-point numbers. A better way would be to leverage `>` and `<`, but we want the range to be inclusive, and there are no `>=` or `<=` operators. We can however leverage the `!` operator.

Here we're saying "give me all users whose ID is not less than 0 and not greater than 9", which is effectively equivalent to our 0-9 range.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/buyers/xyz/users?ID=!<0&ID=!>9 HTTP/1.1
```

### Absence of a value

Sometimes you need a list of items where some field either doesn't exist or is null or undefined. To search on the absence of a field, you can combine the negate operator and the wildcard operator.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/orders?xp.Billed=!* HTTP/1.1
```

Here we're saying "give me all orders that haven't been billed (xp.Billed is undefined, null, or doesn't exist)"

### Performance Considerations

Your data is highly indexed for fast retrieval using the methods mentioned above, including deep XP object graphs. However, there are a _few important takeaways_ to keep search and listing functionality efficient. Filters with many `OR` conditions or with values that start with the `*` wildcard character may be particularly performance-sensitive. The larger the set of data, the more likely you are to notice any performance impact. It pays to know the data model well, and use grouping constructs like User Groups and Categories effectively.

## Sorting

In addition to being able to narrow down the data itself, you can also indicate to OrderCloud how you want it sorted. Perhaps you want to sort the results (in ascending order) by the last name of the person who placed an order. To do this you can simply include the `sortBy` parameter for the field you would like to sort by.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/me/orders/incoming?sortBy=LastName HTTP/1.1
```

If you want to sort results in descending order simply add the `!` operator

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/me/orders/incoming?sortBy=!LastName HTTP/1.1
```

## Combining Queries

Searching, Filtering and Sorting can all be mixed and matched to give you ultimate control when defining what is in a list and how that list is presented to your users.

## Pagination

All list responses will return an object with two values: `Meta` and `Items`. The `Meta` value returns important information regarding your query, such as total results, how many results are shown in the `Items` array, how many more pages of results there are, and what page you are currently on. The `Items` array stores the actual results of the resource you are querying.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

  {
    "Meta": {
      "Page": 1,
      "PageSize": 20,
      "TotalCount": 25,
      "TotalPages": 2,
      "ItemRange": [1, 20]
    },
    "Items": ["..."]
  }
```

Lists default to 20 items per page, but you can set the `pageSize` up to 100. If you have more results than the page count, you will have multiple pages. You can use the `Page` and `PageSize` values from the `Meta` object to specify the page (starting at 1) and items per page. Note that unlike the page parameter, `ItemRange` values are zero-based.
