## Overview

Most OrderCloud.io Resources include a method for listing items from that Resource. The items from such a call could very well be in the thousands so being able to narrow down the range of the items returned is critical, this can be done with the use of filters.

## Filtering On XP

Let's examine a common scenario of filtering on an extended property (XP) field. Suppose our XP field looks like this:

```json
{
  "xp": {
    "MoreInfo": {
      "TeamName": "Tigers",
      "Gender": "Male"
    }
  }
}
```

We can use dot notation to access deeply nested values. The following call will return all buyers with team name "Tigers"

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/buyers/xyz/users?xp.MoreInfo.TeamName=Tigers HTTP/1.1
```

## Fuzzy Searches

Fuzzy matches are supported using the `*` wildcard character.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/buyers/xyz/users?LastName=*Smith&FirstName=John* HTTP/1.1
```

This will return both "John Smith" and "Johnny McSmooth".

## Logical OR

You can also use `|` as a logical OR.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/buyers/xyz/users?LastName=Smith|Jo*&FirstName=Johnny HTTP/1.1
```

This will return "John Smith", "Johnny Jones", and "John Johnson". Maybe you want "John Smith" but not "John Jones".

## Negate and Logical AND

You can negate your conditions by prefixing them with `!`, and logically `AND` them together by simply providing the same parameter multiple times.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/buyers/xyz/users?LastName=!Smith&LastName=!Jones HTTP/1.1
```

This will return all users _except_ those with last name "Smith" or "Jones".

## Comparison Operators

Dates and numeric values support `>` (greater than) and `<` (less than) prefixes.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/buyers/xyz/users?DateCreated=>2015-01-01 HTTP/1.1
```

For a more advanced example, let's say you want users whose ID is the range of 0 to 9 inclusive. Ranges are not directly supported, but you can use the existing features to achieve this.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/buyers/xyz/users?ID=0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9 HTTP/1.1
```

Of course that's not going to be feasible if the range is very large or you're dealing with floating-point numbers. A better way would be to leverage `>` and `<`, but we want the range to be inclusive, and there are no `>=` or `<=` operators. We can however leverage the `!` operator.

Here we're saying "give me all users whose ID is not less than 0 and not greater than 9", which is effectively equivalent to our 0-9 range.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/buyers/xyz/users?ID=!<0&ID=!>9 HTTP/1.1
```

## Performance Considerations

Your data is highly indexed for fast retrieval using any of the methods above, including deep XP object graphs. However, there are a few things to keep in mind to keep search and listing functionality efficient. Filters with many `OR` conditions or with values that start with the `*` wildcard character may be particularly performance-sensitive. The larger the set of data, the more likely you are to notice any performance impact. It pays to know the data model well, and use grouping constructs like User Groups and Categories effectively.

## Combining Queries

Filtering can be mixed and matched with Searching and Sorting to give you ultimate control when defining what is returned from a list.
