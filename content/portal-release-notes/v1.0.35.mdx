Released on Tuesday, September 8th, 2020 at 9 PM CST

> The Portal was unavailable between 9 PM and 10:30 PM due to complications during the release. This in no way affected the OrderCloud API.

### Support for OrderCloud Environments
The Portal now allows users to access organizations from OrderCloud Sandbox, Staging, and Production in a single user interface. [Read more](/knowledge-base/ordercloud-environments)

### Authentication with Github and/or Google accounts
- Existing Portal Users can now link their account to GitHub and/or Google from their Profile > Authentication settings
- New Users can now alternatively register for the Portal with their GitHub or Google account

### Portal Username
- Upon first signing into the updated Portal, you will be asked to provide a new Username (something other than your email address)
- Other portal users will be able to search for you by Name or Username when inviting new Contributors

### Organizations
- Organizations created after this release are automatically tied to the OrderCloud **Sandbox** environment, Production Organizations can be created upon request
- New Organizations no longer need a default API client, security profile, or initial seller/buyer user to be accessed in the API Console
- Transferring and Deleting Organizations are actions that now require 2FA (two-factor authentication), users will need to retrieve a confirmation code from their email to complete these requests
- Organization Admins now have the ability to modify the Organization Name in addition to managing Contributors
- Staging Organizations are restored from Production every Sunday
- Staging Organizations have a new **[BETA]** Staging Restore Webhook config that can be used to automate re-creating webhook and integration assignments after each Staging restore

### Contributors
- New contributors will now receive an invitation to join an organization before it shows up in their organization list
- Contributors with the old Manage Contributors permission now have access to Organization Admin, detailed in the Organization section
- There are three new permissions meant to provide more granular control over which types of users a given contributor can impersonate in the API Console

### API Console
- Portal Users are now able to access the entire API Console using only a Seller Organization as context (no need to select API Client or User)
- When using this simplified context, the roles that are granted will match the Contributor data access exactly
- You can still impersonate specific seller, supplier, or buyer users by opening the context selector again (as long as you have the necessary permissions)

### Bug Fixes
- There is no longer a delay when applying filters in the API Console
- API Console number fields that should be able to be set to `0` will now accept `0` as an input
- Expired tokens in the API Console will now be properly refreshed before allowing portal users to make API calls
- The API Client Enhanced UI now allows portal users to clear out client secrets
- The API Client Enhanced UI now properly saves changes to `OrderCloudIntegrationEventID`
- The Webhooks API Client assignment list will no longer remain stale after modifying API Clients
