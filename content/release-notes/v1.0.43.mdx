## Bug Fixes

- We now round the following to two decimal places:
  - `OrderPromotion.Amount`
  - `LineItem.LineTotal`
  - `Order.Subtotal`
  - `Order.ShippingCost`
  - `Order.TaxCost`
  - `Order.PromotionDiscount`
  - `SpendingAccount.Balance`
  - `Shipment.Cost`
  - `Payment.Amount`
  - `PaymentTransaction.Amount`
- We now return a useful and informative error message if you try to list `CatalogAssignments` without required parameters.
- We now return a useful and informative error message if you try to delete a user who has an open order outstanding.
- We now decrement `SpendingAccounts` on delete of a payment and not if it's just routed for approval.
