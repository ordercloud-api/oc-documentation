Released on Wednesday, February 12th, 2020

This release adds the same Elasticsearch-driven [Premium Search features](/knowledge-base/introducing-premium-search) to `GET v1/products` that are currently only available in `GET v1/me/products`. Initially, this will only affect a small group of beta customers, but we will be rolling it out to everyone in the coming days/weeks. **Please review this [blog post](/knowledge-base/introducing-premium-search) carefully, especially regarding the changes in _search behavior_, as it will now be relevant to "admin" product lists.** Contact Four51 if you have any questions or concerns.
