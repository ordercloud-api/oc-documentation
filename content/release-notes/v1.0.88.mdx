Production Release Planned for Tuesday, December 18th, 2018.

## Summary

Several bug fixes and performance improvements.

## Updates

### Search 2.0 Beta

We've gotten some more feedback from our beta group about what they want in this new Search, and we've changed some of our search weighting accordingly.

- We have severely reduced fuzziness in an effort to return fewer, more relevant results. Fuzziness is aimed at improving natural language type search queries, and in a B2B context, frequently customers know exactly what they want, rather than a more general query.
- In queries where a user is searching on multiple fields, we were seeing partial matches from fields earlier in the list rising above exact matches from fields later in the list. We've changed up the weighting on these to favor more exact matches.

## Bug Fixes & Performance Improvements

- We've reduced latency around product catalog changes.
