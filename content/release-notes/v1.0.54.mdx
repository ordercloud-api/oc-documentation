## Bug Fixes

- Now when you `PATCH` the LineItem.UnitPrice, the LineItem Total will update as well!
- We've improved our error handling for invalid rules engine expressions, so you find out if it's an invalid rule when you try to create it, not when you try to submit an order.
- Fixed a race condition where adding the same product to multiple categories sometimes resulted in a 409 error.

## New Feature

- We improved performance for admin category lists substantially.
- We now return a `Buyer` subobject on the me/user model
