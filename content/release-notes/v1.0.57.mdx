Released to Prod on Friday, June 23rd, 2017 at 7:30 PM CST.

## Bug Fixes

- Previously, if you created or patched a Shipment's `ToAddressId`, the response body would show `NULL`. This is now fixed.
- If you had a Shipment's `ToAddressId` set to `NULL`, and attempted to trigger a shipment notification through Message Senders, it would not get sent.

## New Features

- When you add a new xp value to be indexed, previous xp with that value will now be retroactively indexed.
- Performance improvement around logging.
