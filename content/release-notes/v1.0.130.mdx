- New Orders endpoint: **POST** @ `v1/orders/incoming/{orderID}/split` - Creates outgoing Order(s) to Supplier(s), one per unique `DefaultSupplierID` on the products ordered.
- New Orders endpoint: **POST** @ `v1/orders/incoming/{orderID}/forward` - Same as `/split`, but also sumbits the outgoing Orders created.
- New Product property: `AutoForward` - If `true`, indicates to automatically trigger `/forward` when a Buyer submits an Order containing this Product.
- New Order property: `ToCompanyID`, primarily useful to Sellers with outgoing Orders to multiple Suppliers.

`/split` and `/forward` both return a response that looks like this:
```
{
    "OutgoingOrders": [ ... ],
    "RemainingLineItemIDs": [ ... ]
}
```
