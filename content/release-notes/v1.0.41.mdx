## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the Reset Password Token didn't expire. Now expires after two hour.
- Fixed an issue around Promotions with value expressions containing `product.incategory`
- Fixed an issue where you couldn't delete orders after they'd been approved.
- Fixed an issue where you'd get a 500 instead of a useful error if you submit an order without specs if the order contained a specc'd product
- Fixed an issue where you got a 500 instead of a useful error if you tried to assign a non-existent user to an admin group
- Improved large value handling in unit prices
- You now (correctly) need `ApprovalRuleAdmin` and `ApprovalRuleReader` to admin/read approval rules and not `AddressReader`.
