Production Release Planned for Monday, January 14th, 2019 at 7:30 PM.

## Summary

Several bug fixes and performance improvements, for apps using both the basic search, and Search 2.0.

## Bug Fixes & Performance Improvements

- Previously, the [Create/Patch/Update User](/api-reference/buyers/users/create) webhooks were passing the user's password, if present, in the clear. This has now been redacted, as is our policy across the board.
- We have make some changes to our product cache loading in order to improve performance for product listing and related endpoints. This affects non-Search 2.0 enabled buyers only.
- For Search 2.0 enabled buyers, we did some performance improvements around `GET me/products`, specifically around improving performance on searches that use XP extensively.
