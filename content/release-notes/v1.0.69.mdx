## Bug Fixes

- Previously, we had some inconsistent logic about when we evaluated [Promotions](https://documentation.ordercloud.io/api-reference#Promotions) on an order. Sometimes, this would lead to a submitted order suddenly having an invalid promotion, potentially changing the order total.
  As we want to allow a historical record of promotions at the time of order submit, we have now limited promotion evaluation to only orders whose statuses are **unsubmitted** or **awaiting approval**.

- We also fixed a bug around [the rules engine]({filename}../OrderCloud-Blogs/rules-engine.md) for [Order Approvals](https://documentation.ordercloud.io/api-reference#ApprovalRules). If a User is in the approving group for an approval rule, any order submitted by that User that meets the approval rule should be auto-approved. Or, stated another way, because the User is an Approving User, their order does not need separate approval.
