## Bug Fixes
- We've fixed an issue where, if a product on an lineitem has required specs, but no specs are filled out and there's no default, the line item create is successful. Instead, now an error is thrown with with the missing specs.
- You should now be able to successfully set a string as a spec value on a lineitem if the product on the lineitem allows open text.
- If a buyer user has a private credit card **and** elevated roles (`FullAccess`, `CreditCardReader` & `OrderAdmin`, for example), you'll be able to create a payment on the private credit card without errors.
- Admin listing endpoints for assignments (`listProductAssignments`, etc) will no longer return assignments for deleted buyers.
