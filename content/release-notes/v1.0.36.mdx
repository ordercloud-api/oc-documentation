## New Features

- We've added a new sub-object to the LineItem object. Now, when you list LineItems, you'll see the products that are on the lineitem too. This currently does not include the full price break information.
  _New Line Item Object Example_:
  `{ "ID": "6-Ap0yfJ6k2kDxEJhPA4432vjA", "ProductID": "Test01", "Quantity": 5, "DateAdded": "2016-05-19T17:51:46.127+00:00", "QuantityShipped": 0, "UnitPrice": null, "LineTotal": 0, "CostCenter": null, "DateNeeded": null, "ShippingAccount": null, "ShippingAddressID": "2WRMZMDcakaVaoJ6Hf_r1w", "ShipFromAddressID": null, "Product": { "ID": "Test01", "Name": "Test01", "Description": "Test01 Lorem Ipsum", "QuantityMultiplier": 1, "ShipWeight": 1, "ShipHeight": null, "ShipWidth": null, "ShipLength": null, "xp": { "test": false } }`

### Shipping Rates Integration

- We've added UPS account configuration options to the Shipping Rates integration.
- We've added the option to adjust (as an admin) rates that are displayed to users by either a percentage or a flat rate, either at a global or carrier level.
- You can now add a manual shipper as well, to account for another kind of shipper than USPS or UPS.

### Authorize.net

- We're storing the partial card number for single use card payments in the Payment object's XP, so it can be used in the refund transaction.

## Bug Fixes

- You can't see expired Spending Accounts in the User Perspective Spending Account list, and you can't use one to make a new payment either.
- You can create a payment that exceeds the Spending Account balance if and only if the Spending Account Assignment for the relevant party has `AllowExceed` set to `true`.
- Speaking of price schedules, you can now set a minimum quantity, even when the quantity is not restricted to particular breaks. So, you can now say someone has to order _at least_ 5 products, but they don't have to order only 10, 20, or 30, for example.
- A buyer user without elevated permissions cannot cancel their completed orders. (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و

### Mandrill Integration

- We've fixed an issue with the Date Submitted variable for Orders not getting pulled into Mandrill email templates properly.

### Authorize.net

- We've fixed the partial UpdateCreditCard to stop overwriting the CardholderName with `null`.
