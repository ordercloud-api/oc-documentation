Planned to be released to Production Thursday, December 15th, 2016 at 7 PM CST. _This date is subject to change_

## New Features

- We've expanded how you can use categories in the Rules Engine. You can now use `items.total` in your value expressions.
- We've added some new Mandrill variables that can be used in your Mandrill integrations:
  - Line Item Count
  - PO#
  - Ship To
  - Prior Approver
- You can use any Order XP in your Mandrill templates, including subobjects. EX: `orderxp_xpKey`, nested objects: `orderxp_xpKey_xpKey2`, and xp arrays indexes are accessed like this: `orderxp_xpKey_0` (with zero being the index of choice).
- The Shipping Rate integration will now also calcuate shipping rates based off of the Line Item level ship from address, not just the product ship from address. Line Item-level shipping will take priority over product-level.
- You can now use just a username, not an email, to trigger a forgotten password email!

## Bug Fixes

- We fixed a bug where the Product Delete webhook trigger wasn't firing correctly.
- We fixed a display issue in the documentation around sorting priority.

## Client Libraries
