Released to Prod on Thursday, July 13th, 2017 at 7:30 PM CST.

## New Features

- We've added the Billing Information Name to Customer Profile on our Authorize.Net integration.

## Bugs Fixed

- We have added better error handling for API calls that include .NET reserved keywords in the route (typically in a buyer ID, etc.)
- You should no longer ever receive a 409 duplicate error on a `GET` call. Instead this will properly return a 500 error, as this is a bug.
