## Bug Fixes

- Release contains a bug fix addressing an admin-visibility issue with buyer user private credit card objects.

- If a buyer user created a credit card that only they can access, and then used that card in a payment on an order, admin users were unable to update the payment at all. Instead, the API would respond with a 404 not found error, because the admin user did not have visibility into that private credit card. This is a particular problem as admin users are generally the ones to update a payment's `accepted` bool to true once a card payment clears.

- This is now fixed. While an admin user cannot get or otherwise retrieve the buyer user's private card object, the admin user is now able to update the payment that references the private card.
