## New Features

- The [Me endpoint for categories](/api-reference/me-and-my-stuff/my-categories/list-categories) s an optional `ProductID` filter. This allows a user to find all the categories assigned to them that have that product in them, removing the need to give a user the `CategoryReader` role to accomplish this.

_Request:_

    GET https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/me/categories?ProductID=SuperAwesomeProduct

_Response:_

    Status Code = 200

    {
      "Meta": {
        "Page": 1,
        "PageSize": 20,
        "TotalCount": 25,
        "TotalPages": 2,
        "ItemRange": [
          1,
          20
        ]
      },
      "Items": [
        {
          "ID": "SuperAwesomeCategory",
          "Name": "I Contain the SuperAwesomeProduct",
          "Description": "",
          "ListOrder": 1,
          "Active": true,
          "ParentID": "",
          "ChildCount": 0,
          "xp": {}
        }
      ]
    }

- We also added a Me route for `GET`ing a single category! [DOCS](/api-reference/me-and-my-stuff/my-categories/get-category)

  `GET` `https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/me/categories/{categoryID}`

## Bug Fixes

- Previously, if you attempted to submit an order that had a lineitem with a product that had specs _and_ options, it would fail. Fixed now!
  - [need a refresher on product specs and spec options?](/use-case-guides/product-catalog-management/cpq-configure-price-quote)
  - [api reference for product specs](/api-reference/product-catalogs/specs)
- On `OrderSubmitted` [Message Sender Mandrill Templates](https://github.com/ordercloud-api/mailchimp-email-templates), the order total merge variable was not accurately reflecting order total, leaving out promotion discount. This is now fixed. (The API model was never affected, only the Message Sender merge variable.)
- We fixed a bad index that was causing massive performance problems for `DELETE`ing a Security Profile _assignment_. You should be able to go forth and delete to your hearts content now with no fear of the angry spinner!
