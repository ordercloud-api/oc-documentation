Released to Prod on Thursday, March 3rd, 2016 at 8 PM CST.

## New Features:

- **Payment Types** allow using multiple payment types on a single order
- [**Generate Variants**](#generating-variants)

## Breaking Changes:

- DefinesVariant has been moved from the Spec model to the Product-Spec Assignment model

#### Generating Variants

There are 4 things needed to create a product with variants
Spec(s)
Spec options
a spec product relationship that sets Defines variant = true
an explicit call to
`POST {productID}/variants/generate`

it's pretty simple once they're initially set up. Take the ubiquitous shirt example
Specs
_size small, large_
_color red, black_

spec - product = size/shirt/definesvariant = true
spec - product = color/shirt/definesvariant = true

a call to POST
`{productID}/variants/generate`
will generate 4 variants

- small red
- small black
- large red
- large black

Adding specs is pretty simple
add color:blue
and a call to
`POST {productID}/variants/generate`
will ADD the missing variants
1 small blue
2 large blue
The tricky bit starts when a spec is removed. if color is deleted, all the variants are not relevant because color is built into all of them. Delete color and add logo to our shirt. So that this is the config of shirt:
size: small,large
logo: logoA,logoB

and a call to
`POST {productID}/variants/generate`
will only ADD new variants and you'll have 8. Even with the spec deleted, the dependant variant can still exist, it's just not tied to the deleted spec. This is important if that variant is already on an order.

- small logoA
- small logoB
- large logoA
- large logoB
- small red
- small black
- large red
- large black

if your intention is to start over and reset the variants, there is the spec nuclear option:

`POST {productID}/variants/generate?overwriteExisting=true`

This will DELETE ALL variants and regenerate them based on the current spec configurations. If a variant is on a lineitem, it will be removed. The previous example deletes color and adds logo. calling overwriteExisting=true will result in

- small logoA
- small logoB
- large logoA
- large logoB

The key to overwriteExisting=true is that it will always delete all variants and regenerate regardless of the change to the spec configuration.
