## What is access control

Access control in the OrderCloud Portal is the concept of managing a relationship between an Organization you administer and a Portal user or team of users. Each relationship has a set of permissions related to features in the Portal and a list of OrderCloud API roles for controlling data access.

Upon choosing to invite a new Portal user or team to contribute to your Organization, you will be asked to define these relationships. Once the invitee accepts your request, they will be able to view and/or manage your Organization and the data within it, depending on their level of access.

### Organization admin

This permission will allow managing everything in the Organization: team and user access (including their own), permissions, and the name of the Organization. 

>Organization administrators do **NOT** have access to transfer or delete the Organization. These actions are limited to the Organization Owner. 

### Impersonation access

These permissions are directly related to features in the API Console. Organization Administrators can control the types of OrderCloud Users that a contributing party can impersonate (act on behalf of). Without any of these turned on, the contributing party can only access the console as themselves.

- Impersonate Seller Users
- Impersonate Supplier Users
- Impersonate Buyer Users

### OrderCloud data access

These are the API Roles that a contributing party has access to when using the API console as themselves. They also will restrict data access when impersonating users with _more_ available roles in their assigned security profiles. Meaning, when impersonating users in the API Console, the available roles are an intersection of the impersonatee's roles and the Portal User impersonating them.


## Access inheritance

The OrderCloud Portal provides the ability to create teams. A Portal team is a group of users that share a common relationship with one or more Seller Organizations. Individual Portal users can also have their own relationship with a Seller Organization. This means that a single contributing user might inherit access from multiple sources, so how does an Organization administrator know where this access is provisioned when changes need to be made?

### Organization contributors

The contributors list is a flattened view of each Portal user that has accepted access to an Organization, whether that be through a direct user assignment, teams, or both. When viewing an individual contributor, you will see exactly which relationships that user has with your Organization, followed by the "inherited" permissions and data access. This "inherited" access is an inclusive merging of settings from all of the relationships listed at the top.

Each inheritance listed provides a link to where you can view and manage (if you have permission) the Organization access controls for that specific relationship.

#### User Access

Direct user assignments will bring you to user access. Here you create or cancel pending user invitations and manage the users who have accepted individual access to your Organization.

#### Team Access

Team assignments will bring you to team access. Here you create or cancel pending team invitations and manage the teams that have accepted access to your Organization.

## Best practices

In general, it is best to provide more limited access for teams, as the members of each team are managed separately by the team administrators. There is no guarantee that the members of a contributing team won't change. After you've established team access, as certain contributors require additional permissions or data access, invite them in the user access view.
