Sale Pricing is new additional functionality added on top of the existing PriceSchedule and PriceBreak. These changes allow for sale prices to be applied, optionally using a set start and end date. 

## Updated Resource: `PriceSchedule`

```json
"PriceSchedule" : {
	"OwnerID": "marketplaceownerID",
	"ID": "priceschedule1",
	"Name": "Price Schedule One",
	"ApplyTax": false,
	"ApplyShipping": false,
	"MinQuantity": 1,
	"MaxQuantity": null,
	"UseCumulativeQuantity": false,
	"RestrictedQuantity": false,
	"SaleStart": "2022-03-02T00:00:00.00+00:00", // NEW - optional
	"SaleEnd": "2022-03-02T00:00:00.00+00:00", // NEW - optional
	"IsOnSale": true, // NEW - readonly - determined from current date/time falling within SaleStart/SaleEnd date AND existence of PriceBreak.SalePrice
	"PriceBreaks": [
		{
			"Quantity": 1,
			"Price": 20,
			"SalePrice": 15 // NEW - optional
		}
	],
	"Currency": null,
	"xp": {}
}
```
If sale pricing is active, that sale price is used to determine the line item unit price.

## New Properties

`PriceSchedule.SaleStart`
- Used to define the start date to be used for a `PriceBreak.SalePrice` to be active.
- Optional.
- Stored date/time will be converted to UTC.

`PriceSchedule.SaleEnd`
- Used to define the end date to be used for a `PriceBreak.SalePrice` to be active.
- Optional.
- Stored date/time will be converted to UTC.

`PriceSchedule.IsOnSale`
- Readonly boolean that will be set to true if the PriceSchedule has active Sale Pricing.
- This value is calculated based on if the current date/time is within the `PriceSchedule.SaleStart` and `PriceSchedule.SaleEnd` date/time range and whether a `PriceBreak.SalePrice` exists.

`PriceBreak.SalePrice`
- Sale Price that will override the `PriceBreak.Price` if the current date/time is within the `PriceSchedule.SaleStart` and `PriceSchedule.SaleEnd` date/time range.

## Current Limitations

At this time, the `PriceSchedule.IsOnSale` property is not searchable or filterable as it is a calculated value.

## Tutorial

Although there are multiple ways to provide sale prices to your products with price schedules, in this scenario we want to provide a time based sale price to the **"ProductID": "usb-product-id"** product.

After reviewing the considerations below, lets go through the steps of achieving this!

### Considerations

1. In our example, we will be modifying price schedules that were created in the <Link to="knowledge-base/same-product-multiple-price-schedules">Same Product, Multiple Price Schedules</Link> example. If you follow those steps the required products, categories and catalogs have been created successfully, with proper assignments.

### Modify the Price Schedules

From the previous example, we should have two price schedules for the "USB Cord" product, so let's check to ensure the PriceSchedules exist.

> Our calls to the OrderCloud API should look like this (If successful, our call should return a `200` response and the PriceSchedule):

<CodeExample
  title="Verify that the enterprise PriceSchedules exists"
  content={{
    http: `GET https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/priceschedules/enterprise-priceschedule-id HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8;`
}}
/>

<CodeExample
  title="Verify that the startup PriceSchedules exists"
  content={{
    http: `GET https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/priceschedules/startup-priceschedule-id HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8;`
}}
/>

### Add Sale Pricing for each PriceSchedule

Now that we have determined that both the `PriceSchedule`s exist, let's add some sale pricing with some date and time restrictions.
For this next step, we will assign a `SalePrice`, `SaleStart` and `SaleEnd` values for `enterprise-priceschedule-id`.
Assuming we are currently in the month of March, let's assign a `SalePrice` of **2.99** for the duration of the month, which would see the sale price be immediately available.

> **Note:** Modify the `SaleStart` and `SaleEnd` dates to be valid for your scenario.

> **Note:** As `SaleStart` is optional, by not setting a value for `SaleStart` the `SalePrice` would be valid immediately (As long as the `SaleEnd` date is in the future).

<CodeExample
  content={{
    http: `PATCH https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/priceschedules/enterprise-priceschedule-id HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\n
{
  "SaleStart": "2022-03-01T00:00:00.00+00:00",
  "SaleEnd": "2022-04-01T00:00:00.00+00:00",
  "PriceBreaks": [
    {
      "Quantity": 1,
      "Price": 3.99,
      "SalePrice": 2.99
    }
  ]
}`
}}
/>

In similar fashion, let's assign a `SalePrice` and `SaleStart` and `SaleEnd` values for `startup-priceschedule-id`.
Still assuming we are in month of March, we will assign a `SalePrice` of **4.99** for the duration of April, which would see the sale price not be available until next month.

> **Note:** Modify the `SaleStart` and `SaleEnd` dates to be valid for your scenario.

<CodeExample
  content={{
    http: `PATCH https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/priceschedules/startup-priceschedule-id HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\n
{
  "SaleStart": "2022-04-01T00:00:00.00+00:00",
  "SaleEnd": "2022-05-01T00:00:00.00+00:00",
  "PriceBreaks": [
    {
      "Quantity": 1,
      "Price": 5.99,
      "SalePrice": 4.99
    }
  ]
}`
}}
/>

### Verify Valid Pricing

Now let's verify that we have successfully created two different price schedules with `SalePrice`s and our product: USB Cord.
The next steps require that you authenticate as specific users. To check the contents of your authentication token, visit [JWT.io](https://jwt.io).

Let's verify the sale price is active.
In the context of Jane Doe from CloudTech, call `GET https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/me/products/usb-product-id`. You should see the USB Cord product returned with `"IsOnSale": true`, indicating that `"SalePrice": 2.99` will be resolved over the standard `"Price": 3.99` for the `UnitPrice` calculation of order line items.

Let's verify that the product is not on sale.
In the context of John Deer from ComputerDudes, call `GET https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/me/products/usb-product-id`. You should see the same product returned with `"IsOnSale": false`, so even though there is the `"SalePrice": 4.99`, as it's not currently _'on sale'_, the standard `"Price": 5.99` will be resolved for the `UnitPrice` calculation of order line items.


### Conclusion

Congratulations! You now have the knowledge and background to make informed decisions about how to structure your Product -- multiple Price Schedule -- Sale Pricing, and how to make those assignments via the OrderCloud API.
